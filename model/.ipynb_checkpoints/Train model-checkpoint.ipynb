This was such a disappointment, as we liked the hotel and were having a great time in Chicago. Our room was really nice, with 2 bathrooms. We had 2 double beds and a comfortable hideaway bed. We had a great view of the lake and park. The hotel charged us $25 to check in early (10am).\n",

I have to say, normally I am very easy going about amenities, cleanliness, and the like...however our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review. Truly, DO NOT stay at this hotel. When we arrived in our room, it was clear that the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. I figuered, \"okay, it's just the carpet.\" Until I saw the bathroom! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned (i.e., a paper band across the toilet, paper caps on the drinking glasses, etc., it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place. There was a spot (probably urine!) on the toilet seat and, I kid you not, the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things \"appear\" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. Well, the Hilton was proof. I called downstairs and complained, and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. Frankly, I found the room disgusting. The hotel itself, outside the rooms, was cavernous and unwelcoming, with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this. When I got home, I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not, such was the skeeviness of our accomodations. Please, do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel.\n",
